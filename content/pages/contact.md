# Hacker House Contact

Our first ever cohort is set to start in Fall of 2021. Our first cohort will include discounted pricing, and extra one on one help with industry level software engineers as we dedicate extra time to get the initial feedback that will be valuable in creating the best experience at Hacker House. 

We would love to hear more from you, so please do not hesitate to contact us.
